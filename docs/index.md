!!! screwdriver-wrench "Setup"

    - If possible, we do recommend using the **Remote** option over **Local**  ( Especially for *Windows* hosts). This will eliminate  the need to install any additional applications

    - **Remote** option will require an existing NeSI Account

    ### Remote
    
    ??? jupyter "Log into NeSI Mahuika Jupyter Service - Not required if the workshop is running on OpenOnDemand based Training environment"
    
        1. Follow [https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz/hub/login](https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz/hub/login)
        2. <p>Enter NeSI username, HPC password and 6 digit second factor token<br>![image](./images/jupyter_login_labels_updated.png)</p>
        3. <p>Choose server options as below
        <br>>>make sure to choose the correct project code `nesi02659`, number of CPUs `CPUs=2`, memory `4 GB` prior to pressing ![images](./images/start_button.png){width="40"}  button.

    ### Local  :warning:
    
    
    
    ??? circle-info "Local host setup - Windows, MacOS & Linux"
    
        === "Windows Hosts"
    
            * Install either 
              - Git for Windows from [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win) **OR**
              - MobaXterm Home (*Portable* or *Installer* edition) from [https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html)
                  * Portable edition does not require administrative privileges 
    
        === "MacOS"
    
              * Native terminal client is sufficient.
              * It might not comes with `wget` download data via command line (can be installed with `$ brew install wget`)
              * However, it is not required as we provide a direct link to download data in .zip format 
    
        === "Linux"
    
              * Native terminal client is sufficient.
    
        !!! warning "`bioawk` install on all hosts"
    
            One of the tools used in this workshop is `bioawk` which is not a native Linu/UNIX utility. Installing it on MacOS and Linux can be done with `$ brew install bioawk` & `$ sudo apt install bioawk`, respectively. Windows hosts might have to do it via `conda` according to [these instructions](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/bioawk). However, this will require a prior install of **Anaconda** Or **Miniconda**
